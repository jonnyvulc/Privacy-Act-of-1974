SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: I. Background
The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is updating and reissuing an agency-wide system of records under the Privacy Act (5 U.S.C. 552a) for DHS mailing and other lists. These lists are used to facilitate
mailings to multiple addressees and other activities in furtherance of DHS duties. DHS and its components and offices use the system to account for all persons appearing on mailing lists collected and maintained throughout DHS to facilitate mailings to multiple addressees and other activities in furtherance of DHS duties.
In accordance with the Privacy Act of 1974, DHS is giving notice
that it proposes to update one record system titled, DHS/ALL-002 Department of Homeland Security Mailing and Other Lists System (69 FR 70460 December 9, 2004). Categories of records have been changed to reflect the removal of emergency contact information which has been moved to Emergency Personnel Location System of Records (73 FR 61888 October 17, 2008). The routine uses of this system of records have been changed to reflect the addition of information sharing for audits of
the Department and it's components; for breach mitigation to prevent
the unauthorized use or disclosure of information and to prepare for privacy related incidents; with Federal, State and local agencies
related to tracking and completion of training; with the Department of Justice; with the news media. This updated system will be included in DHS's inventory of record systems.
    
 II. Privacy Act
The Privacy Act embodies fair information principles in a statutory framework governing the means by which the United States Government collects, maintains, uses, and disseminates individuals' records. The Privacy Act applies to information that is maintained in a ``system of records.'' A ``system of records'' is a group of any records under the control of an agency for which information is retrieved by the name of an individual or by some identifying number, symbol, or other
identifying particular assigned to the individual. In the Privacy Act,
an individual is defined to encompass United States citizens and legal permanent residents. As a matter of policy, DHS extends administrative Privacy Act protections to all individuals where systems of records maintain information on U.S. citizens, lawful permanent residents, and visitors. Individuals may request access to their own records that are maintained in a system of records in the possession or under the
control of DHS by complying with DHS Privacy Act regulations, 6 CFR Part 5.
The Privacy Act requires each agency to publish in the Federal Register a description denoting the type and character of each system of records that the agency maintains, and the routine uses that are contained in each system in order to make agency recordkeeping practices transparent, to notify individuals regarding the uses to which their records are put, and to assist individuals to more easily find such files within the agency. Below is the description of the DHS Mailing and Other Lists System of Records.
In accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552a(r), DHS has provided a report of this updated system of records to the Office of Management and Budget and to Congress.

C. To the National Archives and Records Administration or other
Federal government agencies pursuant to records management inspections being conducted under the authority of 44 U.S.C. 2904 and 2906.

individual that rely upon the compromised information; and
3. The disclosure made to such agencies, entities, and persons is reasonably necessary to assist in connection with DHS's efforts to

 respond to the suspected or confirmed compromise and prevent, minimize, or remedy such harm.
F. To contractors and their agents, grantees, experts, consultants,
and others performing or working on a contract, service, grant, cooperative agreement, or other assignment for DHS, when necessary to accomplish an agency function related to this system of records. Individuals provided information under this routine use are subject to
the same Privacy Act requirements and limitations on disclosure as are applicable to DHS officers and employees.
G. To an appropriate Federal, State, tribal, local, international,
or foreign law enforcement agency or other appropriate authority charged with investigating or prosecuting a violation or enforcing or implementing a law, rule, regulation, or order, where a record, either on its face or in conjunction with other information, indicates a violation or potential violation of law, which includes criminal,
civil, or regulatory violations and such disclosure is proper and consistent with the official duties of the person making the disclosure.
J. To the news media and the public, with the approval of the Chief Privacy Officer in consultation with counsel, when there exists a legitimate public interest in the disclosure of the information or when disclosure is necessary to preserve confidence in the integrity of DHS or is necessary to demonstrate the accountability of DHS's officers, employees, or individuals covered by the system, except to the extent it is determined that release of the specific information in the
